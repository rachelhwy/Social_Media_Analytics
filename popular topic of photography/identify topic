#Identify Topic
In this project, we scraped images from National Geographic to see which topic of images is popular and get more attention from the audience. We used Goolge Cloud Vision to retrieve the label of each photo and use those labels to predict the engagement of the audience. Use the result for giving weights to each predictors and create metric for engagement. We also used topic modeling (LDA) and giving each category a engagement score as we created above. From those two methods, we were able to identify that wildlife is a popular topic that more likely to improve the engagement from the audience.
